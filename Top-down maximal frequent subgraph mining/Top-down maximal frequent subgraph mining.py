#####A top-down maximal frequent subgraph mining algorithm.
#####It is proposed for mining frequent subgraphs from undirected graphs.
#####It is based on an assumption that a node in a graph have a unique label.

    """
    Convert raw data of graphs (list) into a dict.
    
    Raw data of graphs are stored in a list:
    RawGraph =  ["t # 1",
                 "v 0 2",
                 "v 1 6",
                 "v 7 9",
                 "v 8 10",
                 "v 9 20",
                 "e 0 1 2",
                 "e 0 7 2",
                 "e 7 8 2",
                 "e 7 9 2",
                 ...
                 "t # -1"]
    where, "t # n" means the nth graph, "v i m" means that the label of the ith vertex is m, "e j k p" means that the label of the edge between the jth vertex and the kth vertex is p.
    The label of each vertex should be assigned a unique identification number in {1, 2, â€¦, q}, where q is the number of all non-redundant labels of nodes in all graphs.
    
    The transmofred data of graphs are stored in a dict:
    G_tr[n]["vec"][i] is the label of the ith vertex of the nth graph.
    G_tr[n]["edg"][j] is a tuple (number of the first vertex, number of the second vertex, label of the first vertex, label of the edge, label of the second vertex) of the jth edge of the nth graph.
